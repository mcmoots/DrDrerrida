Circumcision, that's all I've ever talked about.
The very idea of bricolage is menaced and the difference in which it took on its meaning breaks down.
Man is that which is in relation to his end, in the fundamentally equivocal sense of the word. Since always.
Il n'y a pas de hors-texte.
To pretend, I actually do the thing: I have therefore only pretended to pretend.
Even if we're in a state of hopelessness, a sense of expectation is an integral part of our relationship to time.
But the choice is not between repetition and innovation, but between two forms of repetition and two forms of invention.
You have to make it live and survive, and that is a process - a selective and interpretive process.
As soon as you trace something, the trace becomes independent of its source - thats the structure of the trace.
You cannot control the fate of the book totally.
Logos, a living, animate creature, is thus also an organism that has been engendered.
A science of science which would no longer have the form of logic but that of grammatics?
The instituted trace is "unmotivated" but not capricious.
What cannot be said above all must not be silenced but written.
How can another see into me, into my most secret self, without my being able to see in there myself?
A secret doesn't belong, it can never be said to be at home or in its place.
Cinema plus Psychoanalysis equals the Science of Ghosts.
In certain respects, the theme of supplementarity is certainly no more than one theme among others.
A new writing must weave and interlace these two motifs of deconstruction.
Which amounts to saying that one must speak several languages and produce several texts at once.
What would a mark be that one could not cite?
A text remains, moreover, forever imperceptible.
Everything is arranged so that it be this way, this is what is called culture.
As soon as there is language, generality has entered the scene.
Certain readers resented me when they could no longer recognize their territory, their institution.
Each time this identity announces itself, someone or something cries: Look out for the trap, you're caught.
I became the stage for the great argument between Nietzsche and Rousseau.
I do not believe in pure idioms.
I think there is naturally a desire, for whoever speaks or writes, to sign in an idiomatic, irreplaceable manner.
Monsters cannot be announced.
One cannot say: 'here are our monsters', without immediately turning the monsters into pets.
Things became virulent when, after some books on Husserl, I accelerated or aggravated a certain contamination of the genres.
We are all mediators, translators.
Why is it the philosopher who is expected to be easier and not some scientist who is even more inaccessible?
We are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-à-vis.
One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.)
Neither a signifier nor a signified, neither a sign nor a thing
The infinite task is then to show how every speech always dramatize this opposition.
Neither the incised integrity of a beginning, or of a simple cutting into, nor simple secondary, etc.
Neither a plus nor a minus, neither an outside nor the complement of an inside, neither accident nor essence, etc.
To deconstruct the opposition, first of all, is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment.
To overlook this phase of overturning is to forget the conflictual and subordinating structure of opposition.
It is the other's gaze that wins out and decides.
This is still the presence of what we called above the "transcendental signified".
without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of speculative dialectics
Hegelian idealism consists precisely of a releve of the binary oppositions of classical idealism
I do everything I think possible or acceptable to escape from this trap.
This problem of communication and receivability, in its new techno-economic givens, is more serious than ever for everyone.
The circle of the return to birth can only remain open, but this is a chance, a sign of life, and a wound.
I loved what Gide says about Proteus, I identified naively with him who identified, if that's possible, with Proteus.
These critics organize and practice in my case a sort of obsessive personality cult
The first problem of the media is posed by what does not get translated, or even published in the dominant political languages.
Is it so wrong to take account of a past trajectory, of a writing that has in part sealed itself, little by little?
It often seems that I have only typical and common things to say, in which case I join my voice or my vote to that of others.
Probably L'immoraliste sent me to Nietzsche, and Nietzsche led me in the direction of Rousseau.
The difference between the who and the what at the heart of love, separates the heart.
Does my heart move because I love someone who is an absolute singularity, or because I love the way that someone is?
It is often said that love is the movement of the heart.
So fidelity is threatened by the difference between the who and the what.
The form of the question to which he responded thus entailed the response.
Yes, we will all have loved philosophy.
Deleuze never lost sight of this alliance between necessity and the aleatory, between chaos and the untimely.
It imprudently makes of visibility the tangible, simple, and essential element of writing.
Writing is not a sign of a sign, except if one says it of all signs, which would be more profoundly true.
Then we glimpse the germ of a profound but indirect explanation of the usurpation and the traps condemned in Chapter VI.
This explanation will overthrow even the form of the question to which it was a premature reply.
Only these relationships between specific signifiers and signifieds would be regulated by arbitrariness.
But they fall a fortiori outside the field of linguistics as the region of general semiology.
It matters little, here at least, that there is in fact an ideographic filiation of the alphabet.
For the property of the sign is not to be an image.
We must begin with the possibility of that total system.
How is this functioning articulated with the entirety of theoretical discourse, throughout the history of science?
Better yet, how does it work from within the concept of science itself?
The effort will be laborious and we know a priori that its effectiveness will never be pure and absolute.
Like the word “arbitrary” according to Saussure, it “should not imply that the choice of the signifier is left entirely to the speaker”. 
Simply, it has no “natural attachment” to the signified within reality.
For us, the rupture of that “natural attachment” puts in question the idea of naturalness rather than that of attachment.
That is why the word “institution” should not be too quickly interpreted within the classical system of oppositions.
These oppositions have meaning only after the possibility of the trace.
In fact, there is no unmotivated trace: the trace is indefinitely its own becoming-unmotivated.
In Saussurian language, what Saussure does not say would have to be said:
Peirce complies with two apparently incompatible exigencies.
The mistake here would be to sacrifice one for the other.
But in both cases, the genetic root-system refers from sign to sign.
Semiotics no longer depends on logic.
The general morphology of that meaning (Bedeutung, vouloir-dire) is independent of all logic of truth.
What broaches the movement of signification is what makes its interruption impossible.
The thing itself is a sign.
The so-called “thing itself” is always already a representamen shielded from the simplicity of intuitive evidence.
From the moment that there is meaning there are nothing but signs.
Here one must think of writing as a game within language.
From the very opening of the game, then, we are within the becoming-unmotivated of the symbol.
It would not be able to command a grammatology pertinently.
Once more, then, we definitely have to oppose Saussure to himself.
By definition, difference is never in itself a sensible plenitude.
It contests by the same token the professed natural dependence of the graphic signifier.
On that precise point, it is not a question of “going beyond” the master's teaching but of following and extending it.
To avoid “going beyond,” one risks returning to a point that falls short.
I think on the contrary that oral language already belongs to this writing.
It is that very thing which cannot let itself be reduced to the form of presence.
